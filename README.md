# Hangman-Game

Play this super cool game here: https://dry-sea-76113.herokuapp.com/.

I tried to add a video to play when you win, but Star Wars videos are seriously copyrighted.

And then I tried to include audio, but that didn't seem to behave either.

Hopefully I'll figure out how to include media better in future apps!

It's worth noting that I also want to learn how to better structure my JavaScript.

If there was more time, I'd have worked more on restructuring.

Enjoy.
